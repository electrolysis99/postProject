# postProject

This project is build to fulfill the need from Agos Asia in order to review my capability in PHP and LARAVEL framework.

Do note that I didnt import vendor and node module as this project is using
1. Laravel 8
2. Jetstream
3. Livewire

In order to demo this system, 
1. Create PostingController as well as Posting Model
2. connect DB with db name 'postings'
3. run 'php artisan migrate' to migrate tables needed in the database
4. run the system :D

Thank you for reading this, and thank you also for giving me this opportunity.

Regards,
Mohd Shakir

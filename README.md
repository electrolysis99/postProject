# postProject

This is test project in order to review my capability in PHP and LARAVEL framework.

Do note that I didnt import vendor and node module as this project is using
1. Laravel 8
2. Jetstream
3. Livewire

****UPDATED. I've uploaded this project using git clone.**

In order to demo this system, 
1. connect DB with db name 'postings' in .env
2. run 'php artisan migrate' to migrate tables needed in the database
3. seed from database\seeder\DatabaseSeeder to import country database
4. run the system :D

Thank you for reviewing my work, and give me this opportunity.

Regards,
Mohd Shakir
